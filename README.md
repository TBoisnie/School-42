# School 42

List of projects carried out during my training at 42.

> [!NOTE]
> Some subjects in the __docs__ directories might not be fully accurate with the work done due to the fact that I might not have saved them while working on, therefore, added the last version of them afterward.<br>
> Nevertheless, they give an idea about what had to be done.
