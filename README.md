# 42 - Core - Philosophers

Introduction to concurrency programming through 3 variations of the well known dining philosophers problem.
- Version 1 : `thread` + `mutex`
- Version 2 : `thread` + `semaphore`
- Version 3 : `fork` + `thread` + `semaphore`

## Requirements

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Compile

	```sh
	# Change directory
	cd ./srcs/philo_*
		# one : thread + mutex
		# two : thread + semaphore
		# three : fork (process) + thread + semaphore

	# Make
	make [ all | clean | fclean | re ]
		# all : Compile required files and build executable
		# clean : Delete object ".o" files
		# fclean : Delete object ".o" and executable files
		# re : Run "fclean" then "all"
	```

1. Execute

	```sh
	# Run
	./philo_* 4 800 200 150 21
		# number_of_philosophers : 4
		# time_to_die (ms) : 800
		# time_to_eat (ms) : 200
		# time_to_sleep (ms) : 150
		# number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat : 21
	```
